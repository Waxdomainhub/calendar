# W3C Calendar

A calendaring tool is now available for the W3C community.

This Web application has different components:
- [All groups](https://www.w3.org/groups) have a new "Calendar" tab displaying upcoming meetings related to them.
- All users have a [personal calendar](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/calendar) listing all meetings they are
  invited to.
- Chairs and Team contacts can schedule meetings, recurring or not.
- Events and calendars can be exported as ICS files and subscribed to from third-party calendaring clients.
- Group participants and other invited people are notified by email of new meetings and scheduling changes. This can be
  opted out from [your calendar preferences](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/calendar/preferences).

Most of the information provided when creating or editing events will be public, except for joining instructions which
are restricted to W3C Member organizations, group participants and other invited individuals.

Further hints may be found in the W3C Guide section [Organizing a distributed meeting](https://www.w3.org/Guide/meetings/organize.html#calendar).

Should you find any issues with this application or have comments, feel free to
